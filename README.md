# cf-gecko-codes
Some gecko codes for Animal Crossing: City Folk

NOTE: Any behavior or spawn condition codes, including the updated Bug Randomizer, only work on Dolphin or by using Gecko to apply the codes on a Wii/Wii U. These codes will not work when launching the game from a homebrew application using a cIOS.

[cf_gecko_codes.txt](cf_gecko_codes.txt) contains all the gecko codes with short explanations + some comments

[bug_randomizer_2.0_codes](bug_randomizer_2.0_codes) contains pre-generated codes & mappings for the updated randomizer (randomized bug spawn conditions + behaviors). 100 each for USA and JPN

Bug Randomizer Notes
- Flea and Ant are completely broken, so they are both always completely vanilla
- Some spawn conditions (Flea, Ant, and Fly) are broken when applied to other bugs, so they are not in the pool.
- Some behaviors (Flea, Ant, and Bee) are broken, so they are not in the pool.
- There is "vanilla prevention" to ensure no other bug rolls the exact same spawn condition and behavior. However, bugs may roll another spawn condition/behvaior that is essentially the same (ex. Fruit Beetle rolling another tree spawn condition/behavior)
- The weather restrictions for all bugs still apply. Snail will only spawn while it is raining. And any bugs that couldn't spawn in the rain before still can't spawn in the rain
- Spawn condition restrictions still apply in some cases:
  - Hybrid flower - if the peacock rolls another "spawns flying from flowers" spawn condition (most other butterflies), then it will still only spawn from a blue/blakc/purple hybrid flower
  - Red flower - same as above, but for Tiger Butterfly
  - White flower - if the orchid mantis rolls another "spawns on flowers" spawn condition (Mantis, ladybug, snail), then it will still only spawn on a white flower

[RUUE01.txt](RUUE01.txt) - txt file with USA region codes in a format compatible with some loaders (?)

[RUUJ01.txt](RUUJ01.txt) - txt file with (most) JPN region codes in a format compatible with some loaders (?)

[RUUJ01.gct](RUUJ01.gct) - .gct file containing the original gecko codes. Does not include the randomizer 2.0

You can convert .txt file codes to .gct by using the [Gecko Code Manager](https://www.zeldacodes.org/downloads/code-manager)
